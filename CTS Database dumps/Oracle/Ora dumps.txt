11.The EMPLOYEE tables has these columns:
LAST_NAME VARCHAR2(35)
SALARY NUMBER(8,2)
COMMISSION_PCT NUMBER(5,2)
You want to display the name and annual salary multiplied by the commission_pct for all employees. 
For records that have a NULL commission_pct, a zero must be displayed against the calculated column.
Which SQL statement displays the desired results?
A. SELECT last_name, (salary * 12) * commission_pct
FROM EMPLOYEES;
B. SELECT last_name, (salary * 12) * IFNULL(commission_pct, 0)
FROM EMPLOYEES;
C. SELECT last_name, (salary * 12) * NVL2(commission_pct, 0)
FROM EMPLOYEES;
D. SELECT last_name, (salary * 12) * NVL(commission_pct, 0)
FROM EMPLOYEES;
Answer: D
Explanation:
This SELECT statement provides correct usage of NVL function to calculate columns for all
employees. Oracle give you possibility to substitute a value in place of NULL. The basic
syntax for NVL() is NVL(column_name, value_if_null). Notice that the column specified in
NVL() contains an actual value. That value is what Oracle returns; when the column is NULL,
the special string isreturned. The value specified to be returned if the column value is NULL
must be the same datatype as the column specified.
Incorrect Answers
A: This SELECT statement will return NULL value for rows with NULL
COMMISION_PCT column.
B: There is no IFNULL() function in Oracle.
C: The NVL2() function requires 3 parameters, not 2. Function NVL2(expr1, expr2, expr3)
returns expr2 if expr1 is not NULL. If expr1 is NULL, it returns expr3.

*18.Evaluate the set of SQL statements:
CREATE TABLE dept
(deptno NUMBER(2),
dname VARCNAR2(14),
loc VARCNAR2(13));
ROLLBACK;
DESCRIBE DEPT
What is true about the set?
A. The DESCRIBE DEPT statement displays the structure of the DEPT table.
B. The ROLLBACK statement frees the storage space occupies by the DEPT table.
C. The DESCRIBE DEPT statement returns an error ORA-04043: object DEPT does not
exist.
D. The DESCRIBE DEPT statement displays the structure of the DEPT table only if
there is a COMMIT statement introduced before the ROLLBACK statement.
Answer: A
Explanation:
The structure of the DEPT table will be displayed because the CREATE TABLE statement is
DDL operation and it cannot be rolled back because implicit commit occurs on the database
when a user exits SQL*Plus or issues a data-definition language (DDL) command such as a
create table statement, user to create a database object, or an alter table statement, used to
alter a database object.
Incorrect Answers
B: The ROLLBACK statement has nothing to do with the storage space of the DEPT table.
C: The DESCRIBE DEPT statement does not produce the error. It displays the structure of
the DEPT table.
D: The COMMIT statement does not need to be introduced because implicit commit occurs
on the database after creation of the table.

21.The EMP table contains these columns:
LAST NAME VARCHAR2(25)
SALARY NUMBER(6,2)
DEPARTMENT_ID NUMBER(6)
You need to display the employees who have not been assigned to any department.
You write the SELECT statement:
SELECT LAST_NAME, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMP
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = NULL;
What is true about this SQL statement?
A. The SQL statement displays the desired results.
B. The column in the WHERE clause should be changed to display the desired results.
C. The operator in the WHERE clause should be changed to display the desired results.
D. The WHERE clause should be changed to use an outer join to display the desired
results.
Answer: C
Explanation:
The operator in the WHERE clause should be changed to display the desired results. There are
times when you want to substitute a value in place of NULL. Oracle provides this
functionality with a special function, called NVL(). You cannot use operation equal with
NULL, but you can achieve desired results using NVL() function after the WHERE clause.--------use is null
Incorrect Answers
A: The SQL statement will generate an error because you cannot use operation equal with
NULL.
B: The column in the WHERE clause should not be changed to display the desired results.
D: Since there is only one table used in this query you don't need to use outer join to display
the desired results.

22.Evaluate the SQL statement:
SELECT ROUND(TRUNC(MOD(1600,10),-1),2)
FROM dual;
What will be displayed?
A. 0
B. 1
C. 0.00
D. An error statement
Answer: A
Explanation:
Result will be 0. MOD(x,y) function calculates the modulus of x, defined in long division as
the integer remainder when x is divided by y until no further whole number can be produced.
TRUNC() function truncates x to the decimal precision of y. ROUND(x,y) rounds x to the
decimal precision of y.
Incorrect Answers
B: Result will be 0, not 1.
C: Result will be 0, not 0.00 because MOD(1600,10) return 0 and all other functions
(TRUNC and ROUND) return 0 also.
D: There is no error in this statement.

Examine this SELECT statement based on the MARKS table:
SELECT subj1+subj2 total_marks, std_id
FROM marks
WHERE subj1 > AVG(subj1) AND subj2 > AVG(subj2)
ORDER BY total_marks;
What is the result of the SELECT statement?
A. The statement executes successfully and returns the student ID and sum of all marks
for each student who obtained more than the average mark in each subject.
B. The statement returns an error at the SELECT clause.
C. The statement returns an error at the WHERE clause.
D. The statement returns an error at the ORDER BY clause.
Answer: C
Explanation:
The statement returns an error at the WHERE clause because group function AVG() cannot be
used in the WHERE clause. Group functions can be used in SELECT clause and GROUP BY
clause. They allow you to perform data operations on several values in a column of data as
though the column were one collective group of data.
Incorrect Answers
A: The statement does not execute successfully because an error will be generated.
B: The statement returns an error at the WHERE, not at the SELECT clause.
D: The statement returns an error at the WHERE, not at the ORDER BY clause.

27.Examine the SQL statements that creates ORDERS table:

CREATE TABLE orders
(
SER_NO NUMBER UNIQUE,
ORDER_ID NUMBER,
ORDER_DATE DATE NOT NULL
STATUS VARCHAR2(10)
CHECK (status IN ('CREDIT','CASH')),
p[
REFERENCES PRODUCTS(PRODUCT_ID),
ORD_TOTAL NUMBER,
PRIMARY KEY (order id, order date));

For which columns would an index be automatically created when you execute the above SQL statement? (Choose two)
A. SER_NO
B. ORDER_ID
C. STATUS
D. PROD_ID
E. ORD_TOTAL
F. Composite index on ORDER_ID and ORDER_DATE
Answer: A, F
Explanation:
Indexes are created automatically by Oracle to support integrity constraints that enforce
uniqueness. The two types of integrity constraints that enforce uniqueness are PRIMARY
KEY and UNIQUE constraints. When the primary key or UNIQUE constraint is declared, a
unique index to support the column's uniqueness is also created, and all values in all columns
that were defined as part of the primary key or UNIQUE constraint are placed into the index.
Incorrect Answers
B: There will not be index for ORDER_ID column.
C: There will not be index for STATUS column.
D: There will not be index for PROD_ID column.
E: There will not be index for ORD_TOTAL column.

28.You created a view called EMP_DEPT_VU that contains three columns from the
EMPLOYEES and DEPARTMENTS tables:
EMPLOYEE_ID, EMPLOYEE_NAME AND DEPARTMENT_NAME.
The DEPARTMENT_ID column of the EMPLOYEES table is the foreign key to the
primary key DEPARTMENT_ID column of the DEPARTMENTS table.
You want to modify the view by adding a fourth column, MANAGER_ID of NUMBER data type from the EMPLOYEES tables.
How can you accomplish this task?
A. ALTER VIEW emp_dept_vu (ADD manager_id NUMBER);
B. MODIFY VIEW emp_dept_vu (ADD manager_id NUMBER);
C. ALTER VIEW emp_dept_vu AS
SELECT employee_id, employee_name,
department_name, manager_id
FROM employee e, departments d
WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id;
D. MODIFY VIEW emp_dept_vu AS
SELECT employee_id, employee_name,
department_name, manager_id
FROM employees e, departments d
WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id;
E. CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW emp_dept_vu AS
SELECT employee_id, employee_name,
department_name, manager_id
FROM employees e, departments d
WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id;
F. You must remove the existing view first, and then run the CREATE VIEW command
with a new column list to modify a view.
Answer: E
Explanation:
When we want to alter the underlying data used in the definition of a view, we use the
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement. When a CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW
statement is issued, Oracle will disregard the error that arises when it encounters the view that
already exists with that name, and it will overwrite the definition for the old view with the
definition for the new one.
Incorrect Answers
A: There is no ALTER VIEW command in Oracle.
B: There is no MODIFY VIEW command in Oracle.
C: There is no ALTER VIEW command in Oracle.
D: There is no MODIFY VIEW command in Oracle.
F: You don't need to remove the existing view to create modified view. You are able to do
that with CREATE OR REPLACE command.

KEY and UNIQUE constraints. When the primary key or UNIQUE constraint is declared, a unique index to support the column's uniqueness is also created, and all values in all columns that were defined as part of the primary key or UNIQUE constraint are placed into the index.
Incorrect Answers
A: Oracle will not implicitly create an unique index for the NOT NULL constraint.
C: Oracle will not implicitly create an unique index for the FOREIGN KEY constraint.
D: Oracle will not implicitly create an unique index for the FOREIGN KEY constraint.

31.Examine the structure of the EMPLOYEES and NEW_EMPLOYEES tables:
EMPLOYEES
EMPLOYEE_ID NUMBER Primary Key
FIRST_NAME VARCHARD2(25)
LAST_NAME VARCHARD2(25)
HIRE_DATE DATE
NEW EMPLOYEES
EMPLOYEE_ID NUMBER Primary Key
NAME VARCHAR2(60)
Which UPDATE statement is valid?
A. UPDATE new_employees SET name = (Select last_name||
first_name
FROM employees
Where employee_id=180)
WHERE employee_id =180;
B. UPDATE new_employees SET name = (SELECT
last_name||first_name
FROM employees)
WHERE employee_id =180;
C. UPDATE new_employees SET name = (SELECT last_name||
first_name
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id=180)
WHERE employee_id =(SELECT employee_id
FROM new employees);
D. UPDATE new_employees SET name = (SELECT last name||
first_name
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id=
(SELECT employee_id
FROM new_employees))
WHERE employee_id
=180;
Answer: A
Explanation:
Sub-query in this answer will return one row value, concatenated first and last name for the
employee with ID 180, so update will be successful. When sub-queries are linked to the
parent by equality comparisons, the parent query expects only one row of data from the subquery.
Incorrect Answers
B: Sub-query will return concatenated first and last name for ALL records from the table
EMPLOYEES. It will cause an error for the parent query, because it expects one only one
row.
C: Last WHERE statement in this query will generate error because sub-query returns multirow
result.
D: SELECT statement for the NEW_EMPLOYEES table in this query will generate error
because sub-query returns multi-row result.

You need to create a view called EMP_VU that allows the user to insert rows through the view.
 Which SQL statement, when used to create the EMP_VU view, allows the user to insert rows?
A. CREATE VIEW emp_Vu AS
SELECT employee_id, emp_name,
department_id
FROM employees
WHERE mgr_id IN (102, 120);
B. CREATE VIEW emp_Vu AS

GROUP BY department_id;
D. CREATE VIEW emp_Vu AS
SELECT employee_id, emp_name, job_id,
DISTINCT department_id
FROM employees;
Answer: B
Explanation:
This statement will create view that can be used to change tables in underlying table through
simple views. It includes primary key, NOT NULL column and foreign key to avoid
constraint restrictions.
Incorrect Answers
A: This statement does not include JOB_ID column that cannot be NULL. In general, all
constraint restrictions defined on the underlying table also apply to modifying data via the
view. For example, you can't add data to an underlying table via a view that violates the
table's primary key constraint.
C: You cannot update a column of an underlying table if the simple view use a single-row
function to define the column.
D: You may not insert, update, or delete records data on the table underlying the simple view
if the SELECT statement creating the view contains a GROUP BY clause, GROUP
function, or DISTINCT clause.

e.job id, e.salary);
C. MERGE INTO emp_hist eh
USING employees e
ON (eh.employee_id = e.employee_id)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
UPDATE emp hist SET eh.name = e.name,
eh.job_id = e.job_id,
eh.salary = e.salary
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN

eh.job_id = e.job_id,
eh.salary = e.salary
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
INSERT INTO emp_hist
VALUES (e.employee_id, e.name, e.job_id, e.salary);
Answer: B
Explanation:
This task can be done using the MERGE command. Correct syntax for the MERGE command
is MERGE INTO table1 USING table2 on (join_condition) WHEN MATCHED UPDATE
SET col1 = value WHEN NOT MATCHED INSERT (column_list) values (column_values).
Incorrect Answers
A: MERGE command can handle this task, not UPDATE: new employee details will not be
added to the table
C: This statement would by correct if UPDATE SET is syntax used, not UPDATE
table_name SET syntax as in usual UPDATE command.
D: "ON condition" clause of the MERGE command is absent.

50.Examine the data in the EMPLOYEES table.
EMPLOYEES
On the EMPLOYEES table, EMPLOYEE_ID is the primary key. MGR_ID is the ID of
managers and refers to the EMPLOYEE_ID. The JOB_ID column is a NOT NULL
column.
Evaluate this DELETE statement:
DELETE employee_id, salary, job_id
FROM employees
WHERE dept_id = 90;
Why does the DELETE statement fail when you execute it?
A. There is no row with dept_id 90 in the EMPLOYEES table.
B. You cannot delete the JOB_ID column because it is a NOT NULL column.
C. You cannot specify column names in the DELETE clause of the DELETE statement.
D. You cannot delete the EMPLOYEE_ID column because it is the primary key of the
table.
Answer: C
Explanation:
You cannot specify column names in the DELETE clause of the DELETE statement. Syntax
of this command is: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE column_name = value.
Incorrect Answers
A: Error in this statement is related with list of columns in the DELETE statement, not with
absence of row with DEPT_ID = 90 in the EMPLOYEES table.
B: Error in this statement is related with list of columns in the DELETE statement, not with
NOT NULL constraint on the JOB_ID column.
D: Error in this statement is related with list of columns in the DELETE statement, not with
the primary key constraint on the EMPLOYEE_ID column.

FROM EMPLOYEES
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
What is true about them?
A. The two statements produce identical results.
B. The second statement returns a syntax error.
C. There is no need to specify DESC because the results are sorted in descending order
by default.
D. The two statements can be made to produce identical results by adding a column alias
for the salary column in the second SQL statement.
Answer: A
Explanation:
These two statements produce identical results, because it is possible even to use numbers to
indicate the column position where Oracle should order the output from a statement.
Incorrect Answers
B: Second statement is correct and it will not return a syntax error.
C: The results are sorted in ascending order by default.
D: There is no corrections need to be made for the statements. They will return identical
results.

D. SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'FMDY, DDD Month, YYYY')
FROM dual;
E. SELECT TO_DATE(SYSDATE, 'FMDY, DDD Month, YYYY')
FROM dual;
Answer: C
Explanation:
This answer is correct: "Day" shows the day spelled out, "DD" shows the two-digit date,
"Month" provides the month spelled out, "YYYY" shows the four-digit year. "FMDay" is
special format mask to suppresses the extra spaces between the name of the day and the
number of the date.

A: This statement will return an error because of inappropriate usage of the TO_DATE()
function.
B: Incorrect format mask "DY" is used to show the number of the day.
D: Incorrect format mask "DY" is used to show the name of the day and format mask "DDD"
is used to show the number of the day.
E: Incorrect format mask "DY" is used to show the name of the day and format mask "DDD"
is used to show the number of the day. Also this statement will return an error because of
inappropriate usage of the TO_DATE() function.

WHERE postal code IS NVL;
E. SELECT customer_id, customer_name
FROM customers
WHERE postal_code = NULL;
Answer: C
Explanation:
This statement returns the rows in the CUSTOMERS table that do not have a postal code. The
correct syntax to check NULL values is usage of "IS NULL" clause.
Incorrect Answers
A: "CONTAINS NULL" is incorrect clause in Oracle.
B: This statement will just check if postal code equals to string '________';
D: Usage of "IS NVL" is incorrect in Oracle. But there is a function NVL() you can use to
process NULL values.
E: You can not use equal comparison to check whether value is NULL or not. Use
construction "IS NULL" or "IS NOT NULL" to do that.

57.You need to create a view EMP_VU. The view should allow the users to manipulate the
records of only the employees that are working for departments 10 or 20.
Which SQL statement would you use to create the view EMP_VU?
A. CREATE VIEW emp_vu AS
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (10,20);
B. CREATE VIEW emp_vu AS
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (10,20)
WITH READ ONLY;
C. CREATE VIEW emp_vu AS
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (10,20)
WITH CHECK OPTION;
D. CREATE FORCE VIEW emp_vu AS
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (10,20);
E. CREATE FORCE VIEW emp_vu AS
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (10,20)
NO UPDATE;
Answer: C
Explanation:
Tables that underlie views often have constraints that limit the data that can be added to those
tables. Views cannot add data to the underlying table that would violate the table's
constraints. However, you can also define a view to restrict the user's ability to change
underlying table data even further, effectively placing a special constraint for data
manipulation through the view. This additional constraint says that INSERT or UPDATE
statements issued against the view are cannot create rows that the view cannot subsequently
select. This constraint is configured when the view is defined by adding the WITH CHECK
OPTION to the CREATE VIEW statement.
Incorrect Answers
A: This view does not provide correct semantic of question task.
B: WITH READ ONLY clause is incorrect syntax in the CREATE VIEW command.
D: This view does not provide correct semantic of question task.
E: NO UPDATE clause is incorrect syntax in the CREATE VIEW command.

ORDER BY marks DESC)
WHERE ROWNUM <= 10
AND finish_date BETWEEN '01-JAN-99' AND '31-DEC-99'
AND course_id = 'INT_SQL';
Answer: D
Explanation:
This statement using inline sub-query will provide correct results to show 10 students who
achieved the highest ranking in the course INT SQL and who completed the course in the year
1999.
Incorrect Answers
A: This view will just show first 10 students from the STUDENTS table with limitation on
the course INT SQL and who completed the course in the year 1999.
B: It's wrong to use here ROWID to achieve desired results.

59.Which four statements correctly describe functions that are available in SQL? (Choose
four)
A. INSTR returns the numeric position of a named character.
B. NVL2 returns the first non-null expression in the expression list.
C. TRUNCATE rounds the column, expression, or value to n decimal places.
D. DECODE translates an expression after comparing it to each search value.
E. TRIM trims the heading of trailing characters (or both) from a character string.
F. NVL compares two expressions and returns null if they are equal, or the first
expression of they are not equal.
G. NULLIF compares twp expressions and returns null if they are equal, or the first
expression if they are not equal.
Answer: A, D, E, G
Explanation:
INSTR returns the numeric position of a named character. DECODE translates an expression
after comparing it to each search value. TRIM trims the heading of trailing characters (or
both) from a character string. NULLIF compares twp expressions and returns null if they are
equal, or the first expression if they are not equal.
Incorrect Answers
B: This statement is not correct. The following is the Syntax for NVL2 function:
NVL2(expr1, expr2, expr3). If expr1 is not null, NVL2 returns expr2. If expr1 is null,
NVL2 returns expr3.
C: Command TRUNCATE is used to remove all row data from the table, while leaving the
definition of the table intact, including the definition of constraints and any associated
database objects as indexes, constraints, and triggers on the table.
F: NVL returns second parameter value if first one is NULL.

2 20 1000
3 10
4 10 600
5 30 800
6 30 200
7 10
The COMMISSION column shows the monthly commission earned by the employee.
Which three tasks would require subqueries or joins in order to perform in a single
step? (Choose three)
A. Deleting the records of employees who do not earn commission.
B. Increasing the commission of employee 3 by the average commission earned in
department 20.
C. Finding the number of employees who do NOT earn commission and are working for
department 20.
D. Inserting into the table a new employee 10 who works for department 20 and earns a
commission that is equal to the commission earned by employee 3.
E. Creating a table called COMMISSION that has the same structure and data as the
columns EMP_ID and COMMISSIONS of the EMP table.
F. Decreasing the commission by 150 for the employees who are working in department
30 and earning a commission of more then 800.
Answer: B, D, E
Explanation:
Increasing the commission of employee 3 by the average commission earned in department 20
will require sub-queries or joins in order to perform in a single step. Inserting into the table a
new employee 10 who works for department 20 and earns a commission that is equal to the
commission earned by employee 3 is correct answer also. To create a table that has the same
structure as subset of columns from another table it's required to use a subquery in order to
perform in a single step.
Incorrect Answers
A: This query can be done without using sub-queries or joins in order to perform in a single
step.
C: It is not required to use sub-queries or joins to create SQL statement for that query.
F: This query can be done without using sub-queries or joins in order to perform in a single
step: only two conditions in the WHERE clause should be specified.

66.Mary has a view called EMP_DEPT_LOC_VU that was created based on the
EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS, and LOCATIONS tables. She granted SELECT
privilege to Scott on this view.
Which option enables Scott to eliminate the need to qualify the view with the name
MARY .EMP_DEP_LOC_VU each time the view is referenced?
A. Scott can create a synonym for the EMP_DEPT_LOC_VU bus using the command:
CREATE PRIVATE SYNONYM EDL_VU
FOR mary.EMP DEPT_LOC_VU;
then he can prefix the columns with this synonymn.
B. Scott can create a synonym for the EMP_DEPT_LOC_VU by using the command:
CREATE SYNONYM EDL_VU
FOR mary.EMP_DEPT_LOC_VU;
then he can prefix the columns with this synonym.

A. The indexed column is declared as NOT NULL.
B. The indexed columns are used in the FROM clause.
C. The indexed columns are part of an expression.
D. The indexed column contains a wide range of values.
Answer: D

You need to update the records of employees 103 and 115. The UPDATE statement you
specify should update the rows with the values specified below:
JOB_ID: Default value specified for this column definition.
SAL: Maximum salary earned for the job ID SA_REP.
COMM_PCT: Default value specified for this commission percentage column, if any.
If no default value is specified for the column, the value should be
NULL.
DEPARTMENT_ID: Supplied by the user during run time through substitution variable.
Which UPDATE statement meets the requirements?
A. UPDATE employees
SET job_id = DEFAULT
AND Sal = (SELECT MAX(sal)
FROM employees
WHERE job_id = 'SA_REP')

A: You cannot use syntax like UPDATE table_name SET column_name1 = value AND
column_name2 = value2. Correct syntax is UPDATE table_name SET column_name1 =
value, column_name2 = value2.
B: You cannot use syntax like UPDATE table_name SET column_name1 = value AND
column_name2 = value2. Correct syntax is UPDATE table_name SET column_name1 =
value, column_name2 = value2.
D: Group function is not allowed to use in the SET clause of the UPDATE command.
E: You cannot set column to value DEFAULT OR NULL: this is wrong syntax to use.

79.Which operator can be used with a multiple-row subquery?
A. =
B. LIKE
C. BETWEEN
D. NOT IN
E. IS
F. <>
Answer: D
Explanation:
Only NOT IN operator can be used with a multi-row sub-query. All others may be used with
single-row sub-query only.
Incorrect Answers
A: When sub-queries are linked to the parent by equality comparisons, the parent query
expects only one row of data from the sub-query, so "=" operator cannot be used with a
multiple-row sub-query.
B: Operator LIKE will work only with single-row sub-queries.
C: Operator BETWEEN will not work with a multi-row sub-queries.
E: Operator LIKE is used only for single-row sub-queries.
F: When sub-queries are linked to the parent by equality comparisons, the parent query

Constraints can be created at the same time the table is created (CREATE TABLE command).
Incorrect Answers
A: There is no requirements in Oracle that constraint names must start with SYS_C. Oracle
can use prefix "SYS" to build indexes for UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints, but it is
not required for user to follow this naming rule.
B: Not all constraints must be defines at the column level. Only NOT NULL constraint must
be.
